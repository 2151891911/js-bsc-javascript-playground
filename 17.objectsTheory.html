        // lets see a constructor. The constructor's name is written in capital first!

        var Car = function(x, y) {
            this.x = x; //kkeyword "this" is used here because many objects are going to use the constructor function
            this.y = y;
        };

        //afterwards we write:
        var testla = new Car(100, 20);

        // the testla is a new variable that is also a new object which follows the car constuctor-properties

        // if we ask js about testla; then we will get: 
        // car {x:100, y:20} --> that tesla is a car object created by the car-constructor with properties after the constructor's structure!
